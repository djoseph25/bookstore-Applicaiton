Created a bookstore application to give users the ability to search for any book and read a quick summary about the book
utilizing Google Book API. Users can also visit the book store page and purchase any book in their cart. While building 
this web-based application, I demonstrated a strong knowledge of React.JS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Axios, RESTful API, Context
API to manage state and RESTful methods to develop frontend design, client-side validations, and the RESTful API..



- Styled responsive React components with Bootstrap for all screen sizes, leveraged React conditional rendering techniques and 
   imports to create a consistent and streamlined application UI, improving user experience
- Engineered application with React to ensure efficient rendering by utilizing React's virtual DOM, declarative nature, one-way
   data flow, and React Router's ability to display information while optimizing UX client-side efficiency dynamically..
- Leveraged React Context API and React Hooks to help create a readable DRY code base that manages the user's stat.
- Built the entire deployment pipeline for the frontend and backend application through Travis CI to deploy to Netlify
   after all test cases and linting passed
